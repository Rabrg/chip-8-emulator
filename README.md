# chip-8-emulator
A CHIP-8 emulator written in Java. I wrote this just to learn more about hardware emulation but it
ended up being my favorite programming project so far. I plan on trying to tackle a Game Boy
emulator this summer.

I decided to use libgdx for easy hardware rendering, and more importantly, easy cross platform
among mobile devices.
